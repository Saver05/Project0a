Project0a for my Operating System Class

Task

Write a program, stored in a file called p0-1.c, that will read a text file as input and will output the number of times each letter of the alphabet appears in the file.

    Your program must use a struct to keep information
    Your program must use a function that you write to do part of the main task
    Your program must use an array
    Ideally you will treat upper and lowercase letters the same, but as a fall-back, you could treat them separately
